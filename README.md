    #  Before you can start using the OLED, call begin() to init
    #  all of the pins and configure the OLED.


    print("\nSparkFun Micro OLED Hello Example\n")

            file=sys.stderr)
        return

    myOLED.begin()
    #  clear(ALL) will clear out the OLED's graphic memory.
    #  clear(PAGE) will clear the Arduino's display buffer.
    myOLED.clear(myOLED.ALL)  #  Clear the display's memory (gets rid of artifacts)
    #  To actually draw anything on the display, you must call the
    #  display() function. 
    myOLED.display()
