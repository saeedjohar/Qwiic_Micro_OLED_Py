## Example Use
See the examples directory for more detailed use examples.

```python
import qwiic_micro_oled
import sys




def runExample():

    #  These three lines of code are all you need to initialize the
    #  OLED and print the splash screen.
  
    #  Before you can start using the OLED, call begin() to init
    #  all of the pins and configure the OLED.


    print("\nSparkFun Micro OLED Hello Example\n")
    myOLED = qwiic_micro_oled.QwiicMicroOled()

    if myOLED.isConnected() == False:
        print("The Qwiic Micro OLED device isn't connected to the system. Please check your connection", \
            file=sys.stderr)
        return

    myOLED.begin()
    #  clear(ALL) will clear out the OLED's graphic memory.
    #  clear(PAGE) will clear the Arduino's display buffer.
    myOLED.clear(myOLED.ALL)  #  Clear the display's memory (gets rid of artifacts)
    #  To actually draw anything on the display, you must call the
    #  display() function. 
    myOLED.display()

runExample()
```
